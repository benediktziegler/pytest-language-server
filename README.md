A blazingly fast Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for pytest, built with Rust.

## Demo

![pytest-language-server demo](demo.gif)

*Showcasing go-to-definition, code completion, hover documentation, and code actions. Demo also vibed into existence.* ✨

## Features

### 🎯 Go to Definition
Jump directly to fixture definitions from anywhere they're used:
- Local fixtures in the same file
- Fixtures in `conftest.py` files
- Third-party fixtures from pytest plugins (pytest-mock, pytest-asyncio, etc.)
- Respects pytest's fixture shadowing/priority rules

### ✨ Code Completion
Smart auto-completion for pytest fixtures:
- **Context-aware**: Only triggers inside test functions and fixture functions
- **Hierarchy-respecting**: Suggests fixtures based on pytest's priority rules (same file > conftest.py > third-party)
- **Rich information**: Shows fixture source file and docstring
- **No duplicates**: Automatically filters out shadowed fixtures
- **Works everywhere**: Completions available in both function parameters and function bodies
- Supports both sync and async functions

### 🔍 Find References
Find all usages of a fixture across your entire test suite:
- Works from fixture definitions or usage sites
- Character-position aware (distinguishes between fixture name and parameters)
- Shows references in all test files
- Correctly handles fixture overriding and hierarchies
- **LSP spec compliant**: Always includes the current position in results

### 📚 Hover Documentation
View fixture information on hover:
- Fixture signature
- Source file location
- Docstring (with proper formatting and dedenting)
- Markdown support in docstrings

### 💡 Code Actions (Quick Fixes)
One-click fixes for common pytest issues:
- **Add missing fixture parameters**: Automatically add undeclared fixtures to function signatures
- **Smart insertion**: Handles both empty and existing parameter lists
- **Editor integration**: Works with any LSP-compatible editor's quick fix menu
- **LSP compliant**: Full support for `CodeActionKind::QUICKFIX`

### ⚠️ Diagnostics & Quick Fixes
Detect and fix common pytest fixture issues with intelligent code actions:

**Undeclared Fixture Detection:**
- Detects when fixtures are used in function bodies but not declared as parameters
- **Line-aware scoping**: Correctly handles local variables assigned later in the function
- **Hierarchy-aware**: Only reports fixtures that are actually available in the current file's scope
- **Works in tests and fixtures**: Detects undeclared usage in both test functions and fixture functions
- Excludes built-in names (`self`, `request`) and actual local variables

**One-Click Quick Fixes:**
- **Code actions** to automatically add missing fixture parameters
- Intelligent parameter insertion (handles both empty and existing parameter lists)
- Works with both single-line and multi-line function signatures
- Triggered directly from diagnostic warnings

Example:
```python
@pytest.fixture
def user_db():
    return Database()

def test_user(user_db):  # ✅ user_db properly declared
    user = user_db.get_user(1)
    assert user.name == "Alice"

def test_broken():  # ⚠️ Warning: 'user_db' used but not declared
    user = user_db.get_user(1)  # 💡 Quick fix: Add 'user_db' fixture parameter
    assert user.name == "Alice"
```

**How to use quick fixes:**
1. Place cursor on the warning squiggle
2. Trigger code actions menu (usually Cmd+. or Ctrl+. in most editors)
3. Select "Add 'fixture_name' fixture parameter"
4. The parameter is automatically added to your function signature

### ⚡️ Performance
Built with Rust for maximum performance:
- Fast workspace scanning with concurrent file processing
- Efficient AST parsing using rustpython-parser
- Lock-free data structures with DashMap
- Minimal memory footprint

## Installation

Choose your preferred installation method:

### 📦 PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
brew install bellini666/tap/pytest-language-server
```

To add the tap first:
```bash
brew tap bellini666/tap https://github.com/bellini666/pytest-language-server
brew install pytest-language-server
```

### 🦀 Cargo (Rust)

Install from crates.io if you have Rust installed:

```bash
cargo install pytest-language-server
```

### 📥 Pre-built Binaries

Download pre-built binaries from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/bellini666/pytest-language-server/releases) page.

Available for:
- **Linux**: x86_64, aarch64, armv7 (glibc and musl)
- **macOS**: Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Windows**: x64 and x86

### 🔨 From Source

Build from source for development or customization:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bellini666/pytest-language-server
cd pytest-language-server
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/pytest-language-server`.

## Setup

### Neovim (with nvim-lspconfig)

```lua
require'lspconfig'.pytest_lsp.setup{
  cmd = { "pytest-language-server" },
  filetypes = { "python" },
  root_dir = function(fname)
    return require'lspconfig'.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'setup.cfg', 'pytest.ini')(fname)
  end,
}
```

### Zed

Install the extension from the extensions marketplace:

1. Open Zed
2. Open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P / Ctrl+Shift+P)
3. Search for "zed: extensions"
4. Search for "pytest Language Server"
5. Click "Install"

The extension will automatically detect `pytest-language-server` if it's in your PATH.

### VS Code

Install the extension from the marketplace (coming soon) or configure manually:

```json
{
  "pytest-language-server.enable": true,
  "pytest-language-server.path": "pytest-language-server"
}
```

### Other Editors

Any editor with LSP support can use pytest-language-server. Configure it to run the `pytest-language-server` command.

## Configuration

### Logging

Control log verbosity with the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
# Minimal logging (default)
RUST_LOG=warn pytest-language-server

# Info level
RUST_LOG=info pytest-language-server

# Debug level (verbose)
RUST_LOG=debug pytest-language-server

# Trace level (very verbose)
RUST_LOG=trace pytest-language-server
```

Logs are written to stderr, so they won't interfere with LSP communication.

### Virtual Environment Detection

The server automatically detects your Python virtual environment:
1. Checks for `.venv/`, `venv/`, or `env/` in your project root
2. Falls back to `$VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable
3. Scans third-party pytest plugins for fixtures

### Code Actions / Quick Fixes

Code actions are automatically available on diagnostic warnings. If code actions don't appear in your editor:

1. **Check LSP capabilities**: Ensure your editor supports code actions (most modern editors do)
2. **Enable debug logging**: Use `RUST_LOG=info` to see if actions are being created
3. **Verify diagnostics**: Code actions only appear where there are warnings
4. **Trigger manually**: Use your editor's code action keybinding (Cmd+. / Ctrl+.)

For detailed troubleshooting, see [CODE_ACTION_TESTING.md](CODE_ACTION_TESTING.md).

## Supported Fixture Patterns

### Decorator Style
```python
@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture():
    """Fixture docstring."""
    return 42
```

### Assignment Style (pytest-mock)
```python
mocker = pytest.fixture()(_mocker)
```

### Async Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def async_fixture():
    return await some_async_operation()
```

### Fixture Dependencies
```python
@pytest.fixture
def fixture_a():
    return "a"

@pytest.fixture
def fixture_b(fixture_a):  # Go to definition works on fixture_a
    return fixture_a + "b"
```

## Fixture Priority Rules

pytest-language-server correctly implements pytest's fixture shadowing rules:
1. **Same file**: Fixtures defined in the same file have highest priority
2. **Closest conftest.py**: Searches parent directories for conftest.py files
3. **Virtual environment**: Third-party plugin fixtures

### Fixture Overriding

The LSP correctly handles complex fixture overriding scenarios:

```python
# conftest.py (parent)
@pytest.fixture
def cli_runner():
    return "parent runner"

# tests/conftest.py (child)
@pytest.fixture
def cli_runner(cli_runner):  # Overrides parent
    return cli_runner  # Uses parent

# tests/test_example.py
def test_example(cli_runner):  # Uses child
    pass
```

When using find-references:
- Clicking on the **function name** `def cli_runner(...)` shows references to the child fixture
- Clicking on the **parameter** `cli_runner(cli_runner)` shows references to the parent fixture
- Character-position aware to distinguish between the two

## Supported Third-Party Fixtures

Automatically discovers fixtures from popular pytest plugins:
- **pytest-mock**: `mocker`, `class_mocker`
- **pytest-asyncio**: `event_loop`
- **pytest-django**: Database fixtures
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage fixtures
- And any other pytest plugin in your environment

## Architecture

- **Language**: Rust 🦀
- **LSP Framework**: tower-lsp
- **Parser**: rustpython-parser
- **Concurrency**: tokio async runtime
- **Data Structures**: DashMap for lock-free concurrent access
