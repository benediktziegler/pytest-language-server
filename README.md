A blazingly fast Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation for pytest, built with Rust.

## Features

### 🎯 Go to Definition
Jump directly to fixture definitions from anywhere they're used:
- Local fixtures in the same file
- Fixtures in `conftest.py` files
- Third-party fixtures from pytest plugins (pytest-mock, pytest-asyncio, etc.)
- Respects pytest's fixture shadowing/priority rules

### 🔍 Find References
Find all usages of a fixture across your entire test suite:
- Works from fixture definitions or usage sites
- Character-position aware (distinguishes between fixture name and parameters)
- Shows references in all test files

### 📚 Hover Documentation
View fixture information on hover:
- Fixture signature
- Source file location
- Docstring (with proper formatting and dedenting)
- Markdown support in docstrings

### ⚡️ Performance
Built with Rust for maximum performance:
- Fast workspace scanning with concurrent file processing
- Efficient AST parsing using rustpython-parser
- Lock-free data structures with DashMap
- Minimal memory footprint

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install pytest-language-server
```

### From Crates.io

```bash
cargo install pytest-language-server
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/patrick91/pytest-language-server
cd pytest-language-server
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/pytest-language-server`.

## Setup

### Neovim (with nvim-lspconfig)

```lua
require'lspconfig'.pytest_lsp.setup{
  cmd = { "pytest-language-server" },
  filetypes = { "python" },
  root_dir = function(fname)
    return require'lspconfig'.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'setup.cfg', 'pytest.ini')(fname)
  end,
}
```

### VS Code

Install the extension from the marketplace (coming soon) or configure manually:

```json
{
  "pytest-language-server.enable": true,
  "pytest-language-server.path": "pytest-language-server"
}
```

### Other Editors

Any editor with LSP support can use pytest-language-server. Configure it to run the `pytest-language-server` command.

## Configuration

### Logging

Control log verbosity with the `RUST_LOG` environment variable:

```bash
# Minimal logging (default)
RUST_LOG=warn pytest-language-server

# Info level
RUST_LOG=info pytest-language-server

# Debug level (verbose)
RUST_LOG=debug pytest-language-server

# Trace level (very verbose)
RUST_LOG=trace pytest-language-server
```

Logs are written to stderr, so they won't interfere with LSP communication.

### Virtual Environment Detection

The server automatically detects your Python virtual environment:
1. Checks for `.venv/`, `venv/`, or `env/` in your project root
2. Falls back to `$VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable
3. Scans third-party pytest plugins for fixtures

## Supported Fixture Patterns

### Decorator Style
```python
@pytest.fixture
def my_fixture():
    """Fixture docstring."""
    return 42
```

### Assignment Style (pytest-mock)
```python
mocker = pytest.fixture()(_mocker)
```

### Async Fixtures
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def async_fixture():
    return await some_async_operation()
```

### Fixture Dependencies
```python
@pytest.fixture
def fixture_a():
    return "a"

@pytest.fixture
def fixture_b(fixture_a):  # Go to definition works on fixture_a
    return fixture_a + "b"
```

## Fixture Priority Rules

pytest-language-server correctly implements pytest's fixture shadowing rules:
1. **Same file**: Fixtures defined in the same file have highest priority
2. **Closest conftest.py**: Searches parent directories for conftest.py files
3. **Virtual environment**: Third-party plugin fixtures

## Supported Third-Party Fixtures

Automatically discovers fixtures from popular pytest plugins:
- **pytest-mock**: `mocker`, `class_mocker`
- **pytest-asyncio**: `event_loop`
- **pytest-django**: Database fixtures
- **pytest-cov**: Coverage fixtures
- And any other pytest plugin in your environment

## Architecture

- **Language**: Rust 🦀
- **LSP Framework**: tower-lsp
- **Parser**: rustpython-parser
- **Concurrency**: tokio async runtime
- **Data Structures**: DashMap for lock-free concurrent access

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (2021 edition)
- Python 3.8+ (for testing)

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cargo test
```

### Logging During Development

```bash
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run
```
